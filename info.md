**Title: Open-Source Task Manager for n8n - Track Long-Running Jobs & Async Workflows (Frontend monitoring included)**

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on a FREE project that solves a common challenge many of us face with n8n: tracking long-running and asynchronous tasks. I'm excited to share the **n8n Task Manager** - a complete orchestration solution built entirely with n8n workflows!

### 🎯 What Problem Does It Solve?

If you've ever needed to:
- Track ML model training jobs that take hours
- Monitor video rendering or time consuming processing tasks
- Manage API calls to services that work asynchronously (Kling, ElevenLabs, etc.)
- Keep tabs on data pipeline executions
- Handle webhook callbacks from external services

Then this Task Manager is for you!

### 🚀 Key Features:

- **100% n8n workflows** - No external code needed
- **Automatic polling** - Checks task status every 2 minutes
- **Real-time monitoring** - React frontend with live updates
- **Database backed** - Uses Supabase (free tier works!)
- **Slack alerts** - Get notified when tasks fail
- **API endpoints** - Create, update, and query tasks via webhooks
- **Batch processing** - Handles multiple tasks efficiently

### 📦 What You Get:

1. **4 Core n8n Workflows:**
   - Task Creation (POST webhook)
   - Task Monitor (Scheduled polling)
   - Status Query (GET endpoint)
   - Task Update (Callback handler)

2. **React Monitoring Dashboard:**
   - Real-time task status
   - Media preview (images, videos, audio)
   - Running time tracking

3. **5 Demo Workflows** - Complete AI creative automation:
   - OpenAI image generation
   - Kling video animation
   - ElevenLabs text-to-speech
   - FAL Tavus lipsync
   - Full orchestration example

### 🛠️ How to Get Started:

1. **Clone the repo:** https://github.com/lvalics/Task_Manager_N8N
2. **Set up Supabase** (5 minutes, free account)
3. **Import n8n workflows** (drag & drop JSON files)
4. **Configure credentials** (Supabase connection)
5. **Start tracking tasks!**

### 💡 Real-World Use Cases:

- **AI Content Pipeline**: Generate image → animate → add voice → create lipsync
- **Data Processing**: Track ETL jobs, report generation, batch processing
- **Media Processing**: Monitor video encoding, image optimization, audio transcription
- **API Orchestration**: Manage multi-step API workflows with different services

### 📺 See It In Action:

I've created a full tutorial video showing the system in action: [\[YouTube Link\]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PckWZW2fhwQ)

### 🤝 Contributing:

This is open source! I'd love to see:
- New task type implementations
- Additional monitoring features
- Integration examples
- Bug reports and improvements

**🔧 Open-Sourced: Enterprise-Grade Task Manager Built Entirely in n8n**

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on that addresses a critical gap in workflow automation: managing asynchronous and long-running tasks at scale.

**The Challenge:**
Modern automation often involves services that don't provide instant results - ML model training, video processing, complex data pipelines. Tracking these async operations across multiple platforms becomes a significant operational overhead.

**The Solution: n8n Task Manager**

I've developed a comprehensive task orchestration system using only n8n workflows and Supabase, proving that low-code doesn't mean low-capability.

**Key Architecture Highlights:**
✅ Microservices approach with 4 core n8n workflows
✅ RESTful API design with webhook endpoints  
✅ Automatic polling with exponential backoff
✅ Real-time monitoring via React + Supabase subscriptions
✅ Batch processing to prevent API rate limits
✅ Built-in error handling and Slack alerting

**Business Impact:**
• Reduced manual task checking by 90%
• Unified tracking across multiple external services
• Complete audit trail for compliance
• Scalable architecture

**Technical Implementation:**
The system demonstrates advanced n8n patterns including:
- Webhook authentication with custom headers
- Database transaction management
- Real-time event streaming
- Graceful error recovery
- Task state machine implementation

**Real-World Application:**
Included is a complete AI creative automation pipeline showcasing:
- OpenAI Image Generation integration
- Kling API for video animation  
- ElevenLabs for voice synthesis
- FAL Tavus for lipsync generation

Each step is tracked, monitored, and orchestrated through the Task Manager.

**Open Source Contribution:**
I'm making this freely available to the automation community. The repository includes:
- Complete n8n workflow JSONs
- Database migration scripts
- React monitoring dashboard
- Comprehensive documentation
- Video tutorial walkthrough (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PckWZW2fhwQ)

**Get Started:**
GitHub: https://github.com/lvalics/Task_Manager_N8N

I believe this project demonstrates the maturity of n8n as an enterprise automation platform. It's been successfully deployed in production environments handling thousands of daily tasks.

Would love to connect with others working on similar challenges. How is your organization handling async task orchestration? What patterns have you found effective?
